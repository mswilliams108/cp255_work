This is the repository for the final code and products from the CP255 Project on detecting land use change in Kern County, CA.

The Rmd file 'land use change detection' is the first of two RMD files--this generates the change datasets.
The Rmd file 'land use change analysis' is the second of two Rmd files--this visualizes and analyzes the change datasets generated from the first rmd file. 

I may go back into these rmd files and update them to make the code more concise (adding loops where I do batch operations on datasets).
